Here’s a complete and detailed picture of what you need to do from start to finish, including setup, configuration, and testing for your Flask Data Processing App on Replit with PostgreSQL integration.


---

Overview of the Project

This Flask application:

Allows users to upload data files (CSV/Excel).

Cleans and processes the data.

Inserts the data into a PostgreSQL database (Neon PostgreSQL via Replit).

Hosted and accessible via Replit's web interface.



---

Full Setup and Workflow

1. Download and Upload the Project to Replit

1. Download the ZIP file:
Download Project


2. Create a new Python Repl on Replit.


3. Upload the extracted files from the ZIP into your Replit project using drag and drop.

2. Project Directory Structure

Here’s the expected directory structure after uploading:

/flask_data_processing_app
│
├── app.py               # Main Flask application
├── utils.py             # Data processing and database logic
├── requirements.txt     # Dependencies
├── .replit              # Replit configuration
├── replit.nix           # Replit environment config
├── /templates           # HTML templates
│     └── upload.html    # Upload page template
└── /uploads             # Directory for uploaded files (auto-created)


---

3. Install Dependencies on Replit

1. Open the Replit Shell and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


2. This will install:

Flask: For web app development.

pandas: For data processing.

psycopg2-binary: For PostgreSQL interaction.

chardet: For encoding detection.

openpyxl: For reading Excel files.





---

4. Configure PostgreSQL Database

Set Up PostgreSQL Connection in Replit:

1. Open the Replit Secrets Manager and add the following secret:

Key: DATABASE_URL
Value:
postgresql://neondb_owner:cdTVN3nhgPi6@ep-long-firefly-a5asfefh.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require




Create Necessary Tables:

Open a PostgreSQL client (e.g., Replit’s built-in console or pgAdmin) and run the following SQL:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS calls (
    call_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    contact_id VARCHAR(50),
    call_type VARCHAR(50),
    call_time TIMESTAMP,
    duration INTEGER,
    location TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS contacts (
    contact_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    contact_name VARCHAR(255),
    phone_number VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sms (
    sms_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    sender_id VARCHAR(50),
    receiver_id VARCHAR(50),
    message_type VARCHAR(50),
    message_time TIMESTAMP,
    message_text TEXT,
    location TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS applications (
    application_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    application_name VARCHAR(255),
    package_name VARCHAR(255),
    installed_date TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS keylogs (
    keylog_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    application_id VARCHAR(50),
    log_time TIMESTAMP,
    keylog_text TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS chats (
    chat_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    messenger VARCHAR(50),
    time TIMESTAMP,
    sender VARCHAR(50),
    text TEXT
);

5. Run the Flask App on Replit

1. Click the "Run" button or run the following command in the Replit shell:

python3 app.py


2. Replit will expose a public URL, e.g., https://<your-repl>.replit.app.


3. Open the public URL in a browser to access the app.




---

6. Upload and Process Files

1. On the upload page (served from /), select a CSV or Excel file to upload.


2. Upload Example Files:

smsex.csv: For SMS data.

callex.csv: For call data.

appex.xlsx: For applications data.



3. After uploading, the file will be processed, and the data will be inserted into the appropriate PostgreSQL tables.




---

7. Verify Data Insertion

1. Open a PostgreSQL client (or Replit's built-in console) and run the following queries:

SELECT * FROM calls;
SELECT * FROM contacts;
SELECT * FROM sms;


2. Check the inserted data to ensure everything works as expected.




---

8. Troubleshooting Guide

1. Connection Issues with PostgreSQL:

Ensure the DATABASE_URL is correctly set in Replit’s Secrets Manager.

Check Replit logs for any connection errors.


2. Encoding Errors during File Processing:

If encoding errors occur, the app retries with latin1 encoding.

Review Replit logs for detailed error messages.


3. SQL Errors:

Ensure that the uploaded files match the expected structure for each table.

Check logs for any SQL syntax or insertion errors.
