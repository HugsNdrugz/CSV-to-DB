This project is meant to **visualize chat exports from a PostgreSQL database**, displaying them in a **Facebook Messenger-style interface**. The core functionality is to **show the existing data** without re-importing or uploading files on every startup. The **upload feature** should be manually triggered by the user only when needed, and the focus must remain on reading and visualizing the data already present in the database.

### **Issues Observed:**

1. **Contacts List Not Displaying Properly:**  
   The contact list should query the **contacts table** from the PostgreSQL database and show all available contact names in an ordered list. Clicking on a contact should load that contact's **chat data**.

2. **Chat Messages Not Loading as Expected:**  
   When a contact is selected, the related **chat export data** should be retrieved and displayed in a **clean, conversational format**, like a Facebook Messenger thread. Currently, this isn’t happening, and we need to **check the query logic** and **template rendering** to ensure the messages display correctly.

3. **Startup Issues with the `.replit` File:**  
   The current **.replit configuration appears to trigger import/upload operations on startup**, which is not desired. This behavior must be removed to prevent unnecessary re-imports. The application should **only run the upload logic if explicitly initiated by the user** through the dedicated upload page. The default startup should focus on **visualizing the existing data** and ensuring that the database is connected properly.

4. **Database Connection and Query Handling:**  
   The **database connection logic** needs to be carefully reviewed to ensure that queries for both the **contacts list and chat messages** are functioning properly. Ensure the connection closes correctly after each operation to prevent leaks. Also, we need to **handle errors gracefully** and provide meaningful feedback to the user (e.g., “No chats available for this contact.”).

5. **UI and User Flow Requirements:**  
   - The **contacts page** should render all contacts as clickable links.
   - The **chat view** should display messages between the selected contact and others in a readable way.
   - Ensure the **upload page is accessible via a dedicated route**, and that it works seamlessly when files are uploaded for new imports.
   - Maintain a **clear separation of concerns** between the visualization logic and the upload functionality.

6. **Ensure Seamless Flow Across Components:**  
   - Verify the **upload feature** saves the data to the correct tables (e.g., `contacts` and `chats`).
   - On selecting a contact, the UI should **not reload or import data unnecessarily**. It should simply query the database and display relevant chat exports.

7. **Code Review and Optimization:**  
   - Refactor the **Flask routes** to ensure they load data efficiently and handle errors correctly.
   - Ensure the **CSS styling** renders the chat in a visually appealing way.
   - Test the **upload functionality** to confirm it works smoothly when invoked.

### **Summary of Key Actions:**

1. **Correct the `.replit` startup configuration** to avoid running import operations at launch.
2. Ensure the **contacts list** displays properly from the database.
3. Make sure **chat data** loads correctly when a contact is selected.
4. Review the **database queries and connection logic** to prevent any issues.
5. Refactor the **user interface** to display contacts and chats in a Messenger-like format.
6. Confirm that the **upload page** only triggers manual imports, and this behavior is separate from the default startup flow.

This will ensure the project functions correctly, focusing on visualization while still allowing optional data imports when required. Please address these issues and let me know if further adjustments are needed.
